# Homestead Companion

Building software for users in their 70s requires a specific mindset: **High Contrast, Big Buttons, Low Latency, and Zero Ambiguity**.

This project uses **Flutter (Web)** for its ability to build "Chunky" UIs and **Firebase** for real-time updates and backend simplicity.

## Design Philosophy
- **Navigation**: Large, always-visible Bottom Navigation Bar.
- **Typography**: Base font size 18sp+. High contrast.
- **Input**: Minimize typing. Sliders, checkboxes, photo pickers.

## Modules
1. **The Flock**: Chicken management (Daily To-Do, Tasks).
2. **The Knowledge Base**: Wiki for homestead info.
3. **The Garden**: Visual layout and inventory for trees and beds.
